# Portfolio_Homework
This homework assignment was designed for us to practice mobile responsiveness when building websites using bootstrap resources. 
I was able to successfully build a mock portfolio website using bootstrap and incorporating multiple html files with corresponding css
Once the screen size changes the layout of the website adjusts to allow the user to view the content on mobile devices without
 it becoming jumbled. 
The links to different pages on the website all work, as does the drop down menu box when in a small screen.
 
Overall I had a lot of fun with this assingment and learned many new tools for building web applications.
